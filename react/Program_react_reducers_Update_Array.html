        [React] update array in redux
      </h1>

      <div class="info">
        <em
          >* In Redux, our reducers are never allowed to mutate the original /
          current state values!</em
        >
        <br />
        I find it very hard to keep that in mind when I work with array. So there is one time that I wrote reducer like this:

        <pre class="code">
            <code>
    const glossarySlice = (state = initState, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case "ADDWORD":
                return state.push(action.payload);
        
            // Some other cases
        }
    };
            </code>
        </pre>

        And then I received an error from another file which made me very confused at that time.

        <div class="error-message">
            useSelector.js:38 Uncaught TypeError: state.glossary.findIndex is not a function
        </div>
        <br>
        Then I realised I mutated the array in redux by using push method. Js array methods like push, pop and so on need to pay extra attention to. 
        Cause using methods like that may make you break the redux rule without any notice. <br>
        In my case, the push method will push in an item at the end of the array and return the length of the array. 
        So my state array then became a number. As there is no findIndex such a function of the number, I got an error. <br>
        The right way to write this is:

        <pre class="code">
            <code>
    const glossarySlice = (state = initState, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case "ADDWORD":
                return [...state, action.payload];
        
            // Some other cases
        }
    };
            </code>
        </pre> 
        To other changes that you want to apply to an array, the way I am using is to make a copy of the array and then apply changes to new array and return the new array.
