      <h1>
        [React] why using const keyword in reactjs
      </h1>

      <div class="info">
        In vanilla js,
        <ul>
          <li>
            variable with <em>const</em> keyword can not be reassigned and it is
            block-scoped
          </li>
          <li>
            variable with <em>let</em> keyword is reassigned and it is
            block-scoped
          </li>
          <li>
            variable with <em>var</em> keyword is also reassigned but it is
            function-scoped
          </li>
        </ul>
        That is why in vanilla js, we usually use the let keyword. So I was
        confused why in all the tutorial, they wrote variables with const
        keyword in useState hook even when I was pretty sure that those
        variables would change in the following commend. Then I found that when
        properties or states change, the component will be rerendered. And the
        function will be executed again which will cause it to create a new
        scope again. Then, the variable with const will be assigned a new value
        instead of reassigning values.
