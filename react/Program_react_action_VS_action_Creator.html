      <h1>
        [React] Action VS Action creator [Question mark]
      </h1>

      <div class="info">
        I was confused by the action and action creator. So in this article, I
        will explain how I understand it now. <br />
        <br />

        <em
          >In short, action is an object while action creator is a function.</em
        >

        <pre class="code">
          <code>
    // Action creator return an action
    const addWord = (word, meaning) => {
        const lastCheckTime = new Date().toGMTString();

        return {
            type: "ADDWORD",
            payload: {
            word,
            meaning,
            lastCheckTime,
            checkPeriod: 0
            }
        };
    };
          </code>
        </pre>

        addWord() is action creator. It is a function. And it creates action by
        returning an object. While that object is an action.

        <pre class="code">
            <code>
    return &lt;button onClick={() => dispatch(addWord(word, meaning))}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;;
            </code>
        </pre>

        When the onClick function is triggered, it dispatches the action, or to
        say the object.
        <br /><br />

        But there is one thing that I am still not that sure. When an action is
        dispatched, how could the react know which reducer is that if there are
        multiple reducers?
