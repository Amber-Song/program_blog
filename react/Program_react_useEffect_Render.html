      <h1>
        [React] rendering issue caused by useEffect
      </h1>

      <div class="info">
        In the document, there are three conditions that useEffect hook will run
        the function and re-render the component:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <code>useEffect(() => { // do something })</code> In this case, as
            long as the state or props change, the component will re-render and
            the side effect will perform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>useEffect(() => { // doing something }, [item])</code> In this
            case, every time the item change, the side effect will perform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>useEffect(() => { // doing something }, [])</code> In this
            case, it will only perform the side effect during mount lifecycle.
          </li>
        </ol>

        I got some weird rendering issues when I used useEffect hook. <br />
        <br />
        The first one is that when I wrote the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/Amber-Song/dictionary/blob/comment-version/frontend/src/features/dictionary/SearchInput.js"
          >SearchInput file</a
        >, I tried to set the word, use Axios to query the server for meaning
        and then update the meaning. But I fail into an infinite rendering loop.

        <pre class="code">
          <code>
    const SearchInput = ({ word, setWord, setMeaning }) => {
        useEffect(() => {
            axios
                .get(url)
                .then(res => {
                    setWord(searchInput);
                    setMeaning({
                    Word: res.data.Word,
                    Audio: res.data.Audio,
                    PhoneticNotation: res.data.PhoneticNotation,
                    Picture: res.data.Picture,
                    MeaningsBlocks: res.data.MeaningsBlocks
                    });
                });
            };
        })

        // something
    }
          </code>
        </pre>

        After double-checking, I found that when the function in the useEffect
        hook runs, the word will be reset which cause the component to rerender
        and then the function in useEffect will run again. Then it runs on and
        on and on, just failing into an infinite rendering loop by the end.
        <br />
        <br />
        To fix that I used the third way of doing it but forgetting that update
        lifecycle is not mounted lifecycle. So here I came across the second
        issue after I searched a word and tried to search another one, the
        meaning remains the same. Here is the code:
        <pre class="code">
            <code>
    const SearchInput = ({ word, setWord, setMeaning }) => {
        useEffect(() => {
            axios
                .get(url)
                .then(res => {
                    setWord(searchInput);
                    setMeaning({
                    Word: res.data.Word,
                    Audio: res.data.Audio,
                    PhoneticNotation: res.data.PhoneticNotation,
                    Picture: res.data.Picture,
                    MeaningsBlocks: res.data.MeaningsBlocks
                    });
                });
            };
        }, [])

        // something
    }
            </code>
        </pre>
        To solve that, I tried not to change any properties and states inside
        the useEffect hook. And write the changes in the function and use the
        onClick function to trigger.
