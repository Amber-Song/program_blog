      <h1>
        [CSS] id selector in external css file doesn't work! [Question mark]
      </h1>

      <div class="info">
        I try to select the element and then apply the style on it in the
        external CSS file. But when I selected it by its id, it doesn't work.
        While I selected it by its class, it works. <br />
        When I wrote this blog's demo, I found that if you just want to select
        elements and change their style, both selecting by id and class works.
        If you want to apply the style to the elements when your mouse hover
        themselves, both selecting by id and class works. But if you want to
        apply the style to the elements when your mouse hover other elements,
        both of them doesn't work at all this time. If it doesn't work in the
        external CSS file, it doesn't work in the internal CSS file as well.
        There is no error. I still don't know why. <br />
        Anyway here is the demo:

        <iframe
          height="520"
          style="width: 100%;"
          scrolling="no"
          title="CSS_selector_demo_1"
          src="https://codepen.io/AmberSong/embed/xxOqOdE?height=265&theme-id=dark&default-tab=html,result"
          frameborder="no"
          loading="lazy"
          allowtransparency="true"
          allowfullscreen="true"
        >

      </div>

      <div class="info">
        I searched online and found some possibilities for why it doesn't work.
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you add space before :hover, that element will not change the
            style, but all of its descendant elements will change the style.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to change the style of other elements when you hover one
            element, the elements you can change is descendant elements and only
            siblings following it. If you don't add + before sibling element, it
            still doesn't work.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the tag a, a:hover isn't placed after a:link and a:visited.
          </li>
        </ol>
        And I think I found the reason that I didn't work for the above demo.
        When hovering the second element, the last element's style doesn't
        change, because only the sibling element directly following it will
        change. when the third element hovered, the last one changes, because it
        is directly following it. <br />
        Here is some example:
        <br />

        <iframe
          height="520"
          style="width: 100%;"
          scrolling="no"
          title="CSS_selector_demo_2"
          src="https://codepen.io/AmberSong/embed/ExyWyXy?height=265&theme-id=dark&default-tab=html,result"
          frameborder="no"
          loading="lazy"
          allowtransparency="true"
          allowfullscreen="true"
