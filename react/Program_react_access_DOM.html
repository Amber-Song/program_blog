        [React] access DOM in reactjs
      </h1>

      <div class="info">
        When I just switched from vanilla js to reactjs, I felt very it very
        different when I wanted to do something which needs access to DOM.
        <br />
        Like when I want to change the class of one element to another class, I
        used to write:
        <code>
          document.getElementById('bid').className = 'show-more';
        </code>
        <br />
        But in reactjs I can't get the node by getElementById function or
        anything like that. In reactjs, it need to use another way to achieve
        this by making the class or inner HTML or anything I want to change the
        state. Instead of picking the node and change it, I make it variable
        inside state and when I want to change it, I change the value of the
        variable.<br />
        <br />
        I also saw there is another way, using the useRef hook. But I haven't
        explored that one. I will add more once I get more information about
        that.
