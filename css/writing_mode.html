    <div class="vertical-rl">
      This line is in vertical-rl writing mode. <br />
      Another line to show the block direction.

    <div class="vertical-lr">
      This line is in vertical-lr writing mode. <br />
      Another line to show the block direction.

    <div class="rotate">
      Actually the direction in writing mode rl which indicates right to left
      and lr which indicates left to right doesn't show us what we expect. They
      are all block direction instead of character direction which means all the
      character are rotated clockwise. So to make it what we think, we need to
      rotate the text 180 degree. <br />
      We can see the inline direction goes from top to bottom to bottom to top
      now. <br />
      I tried to use lr in this case as well. It seems like it doesn't work, as
      I expect it to goes from left to right.
