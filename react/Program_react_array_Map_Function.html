        [React] array map function

      <div class="info">
        When I was writing the project dictionary, in
        <a
          href="https://github.com/Amber-Song/dictionary/blob/comment-version/frontend/src/features/dictionary/MeaningBlock.js"
          >MeaningBlock.js file</a
        >, I tried to iterate the meanings array to list all the meaning
        following a number. Here is the code:

        <pre class="code">
          <code>
    {meaningsBlock.DefaultMeanings.map((id, meaning) => {
      return (
        &lt;div key={id} className="meaning-li"&gt;
          {id}
          {meaning}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      );
    })}
          </code>
        </pre>

        But it didn't turn out to be what I wanted. It has meaning followed by
        the number, then I realised content come first than id in array.map
        argument. So it should be:

        <pre class="code">
          <code>
    {meaningsBlock.DefaultMeanings.map((meaning, id) => {
      return (
        &lt;div key={id} className="meaning-li"&gt;
          {id}
          {meaning}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      );
    })}
          </code>
        </pre>

        Or:
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
    {meaningsBlock.DefaultMeanings.map((meaning, id) => (
      &lt;div key={id} className="meaning-li"&gt;
        {id}
        {meaning}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    ))}
          </code>
        </pre>

        But you know, you can always use ol and li tag to list items. <br />
        And I was confused at the beginning by the documentation, as it seems
        like when you iterate the array, it can return the transforming item as
        part of the new array without return keyword but in some examples, it
        returns something with the keyword. The item could be numbers, strings
        or even jsx objects. Now I understand that returning transforming array
        is one situation. In the other situation, there are more things you want
        to do during iterating so it can't be made into only one line of code so
        it has to be a function. In function, you return the item with the
        return keyword.
