      <div class="info">
        When I was using goquery library, I was thinking of getting rid of some
        of the content inside the node. So I used not function to filter that
        nodes. But it didn't turn out to be what I want. <br />
        After searching, I found that not function is to filter a list instead
        of filtering all the nodes inside that node within any depth.
