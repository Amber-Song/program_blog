      <h1>[CSS] height or min-height?</h1>

      <div class="info">
        There was one time I used the grid in CSS. As there was one sentence too
        long for just one line, it wrapped to another line. The problem is the
        rest of the content just crashed into each other. I didn't notice I set
        the height a fixed value at that time. <br />
        Here is the demo: <br /><br />

        <iframe
          height="320"
          style="width: 100%;"
          scrolling="no"
          title="CSS_height_in_grid_demo"
          src="https://codepen.io/AmberSong/embed/zYBRaqg?height=265&theme-id=dark&default-tab=html,result"
          frameborder="no"
          loading="lazy"
          allowtransparency="true"
          allowfullscreen="true"
        >

        By setting min-height rather than height, I solved this problem. And I
        wonder when to use height and when to use min-height. <br />
        when you want the height of the element is fixed not affected by the
        content inside the element, use height. overflow: scroll could go
        together with height to show the whole element.
